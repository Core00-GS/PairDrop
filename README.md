## Differences to the [Snapdrop](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop) it is based on
<details><summary>List view</summary>

### Paired Devices and Public Rooms — Internet Transfer
* Transfer files over the Internet between paired devices or by entering temporary public rooms.
* Connect to devices in complex network environments (public Wi-Fi, company network, Apple private relay, VPN, etc.).
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices outside of your local network that are behind a NAT are autop-connected via the PairDrop TURN server.
* Connect to devices on your mobile hotspot.
* Devices that are paired devices, in the same public room, or on your local network are shown.

#### Persistent Device Pairing

Always connect to known devices

* Pair devices via a 6-digit code or a QR-Code.
* Paired devices always find each other via shared secrets independently of their local network. 
* Pairing is persistent. You find your devices even after reopening PairDrop.
* You can edit and unpair devices easily.

#### Temporary Public Rooms

Connect to others in complex network situations, or over the Internet.

* Enter a public room via a 5-letter code or a QR-code.
* Enter a public room to temporarily connect to devices outside your local network.
* All devices in the same public room see each other.
* Public rooms are temporary. Closing PairDrop  leaves all rooms.

### [Improved UI for Sending/Receiving Files](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/issues/560)
* Files are transferred after a request is accepted. Files are auto-downloaded upon completing a transfer, if possible.
* Multiple files are downloaded as a ZIP file
* Download, share or save to gallery via the "Share" menu on Android and iOS.
* Multiple files are transferred at once with an overall progress indicator.

### Send Files or Text Directly From Share Menu, Context Menu or CLI
* [Send files directly from the context menu on Windows](/docs/how-to.md#send-files-directly-from-context-menu-on-windows)
* [Send directly from the "Share" menu on iOS](/docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-ios)
* [Send directly from the "Share" menu on Android](/docs/how-to.md#send-directly-from-share-menu-on-android)
* [Send directly via the command-line interface](/docs/how-to.md#send-directly-via-command-line-interface)

### Other Changes
* Change your display name to easily differentiate your devices.
* [Paste files/text and choose the recipient afterwards ](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/534)
* [Prevent devices from sleeping on file transfer](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/413)
* Warn user before PairDrop is closed on file transfer
* Open PairDrop on multiple tabs simultaneously (Thanks [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* [Video and audio preview](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/455) (Thanks [@victorwads](https://github.com/victorwads))
* Switch theme back to auto/system after dark or light mode is on
* * Node-only implementation (Thanks [@Bellisario](https://github.com/Bellisario))
* Auto-restart on error (Thanks [@KaKi87](https://github.com/KaKi87))
* Lots of stability fixes (Thanks [@MWY001](https://github.com/MWY001) [@skiby7](https://github.com/skiby7) and [@willstott101](https://github.com/willstott101))
* To host PairDrop on your local network (e.g. on Raspberry Pi): [All peers connected with private IPs are discoverable by each other](https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/pull/558)
* When hosting PairDrop yourself, you can [set your own STUN/TURN servers](/docs/host-your-own.md#specify-stunturn-servers)
* Translations.
